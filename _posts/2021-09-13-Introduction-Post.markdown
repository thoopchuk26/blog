This blog thing is pretty neat.

I've worked with command line stuff before so that wasn't too bad but I've never worked with Ruby before because I wasn't really sure what the language was used for so a lot of this is new to me. I'm surprised at how developer friendly this blog is though after the, honestly not
too difficult, setup required for it.

I can't say I've enjoyed the process of setting it up very much though because of how indecipherable the error messages have been for me, but the end result is really clean and pretty easy to use. It is a little awkward to try and edit the blog quickly because you have to host it locally and sometimes it just doesn't want to work for some reason but it could be worse.

There's a lot about the blog that I don't fully understand in the sense that I don't know what the foundations of this blog are, because there's a
lot going on in the background building my website that I am mostly ignorant to, but really that's more of a problem with my curiosity.

I'm definitely looking forward to using this blog as a place to place project and career updates in the future because I think it would fit the blog style better than whatever my eventual portfolio website will look like. I also haven't built the portfolio website yet so that's also helpful.

In the meantime checkout my [Twitch][twitch-link] and the [Hendrix Esports Twitch][esports-twitch] and [Hendrix Esports Twitter][esports-twitter] to not miss any news or streams about our team and support us in our effort to make a great program that brings results.

And before I forget here's a list of my future projects that I don't have time to work on currently:
* Functional Yu-gi-oh Duel Disk
* Motorized Heelys/Motorized pop-out Skates
* Handheld Wii with disc drive
