Once the generation is in a presentable state I think I'll start getting world files up and running.
Something I can write and read from to save map data. Honestly this is the part I'm the least confident
in. There's not a lot of documentation about saving data at this scale and I'm also gonna have to apply
some compression and decompression to the file most likely which is another part of this project I'm
completely unknowledgeable about. It is definitely something I want to include though, although there's
an argument to be made that at this point I should focus on getting placing and removing blocks first.

Oh well.
