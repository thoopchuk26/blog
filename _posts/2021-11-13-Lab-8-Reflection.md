A "little" late but it's the thought that counts right?

This lab was interesting to say that least and required a lot more out of me than I expected
though  not always for good reason. I think the hardest part of the lab was actually the start
because it was very easy for me to have a single error and give up because I don't know what I'm
doing. It wasn't until three-quarters of the way through the tutorial that I actually felt like
I knew how to maneuver my way around razor pages code and it's many features and layouts. 

I'm still a little confused when it comes to html code but it shouldn't cause too much issues. 
It more so comes from an inexperience and overall dislike of working in html code as opposed
to the tutorial giving me issues.

I think the hardest part of having multiple tables was probably dealing with conccurency issues 
between them,I still don't really understand how to properly setup that kind of stuff so I hope
I won't have todeal with it too much in practice. 

Given the nature of our project, I feel very confident building our project for our client,
and given how far we've gotten while I still hadn't completed this lab I'd like to say we won't
have too many issues. Conveniently the tutorial project mimicks our project layout similarly so
it hasn't been too difficult for us to base a lot of our changes around it and work from there.
