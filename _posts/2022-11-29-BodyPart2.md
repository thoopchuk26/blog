Long story short I've been playing pokemon and ignoring my responsibilities. To
expand on that a little bit more though, I've had a problem with finding something
to write about for this draft because for that most part I don't actually have anything
more to talk about yet. I've still really only finished the render engine part and
have nothing else to really expand upon. I could talk about stuff like generation and
noise but it feels a little disingenuous considering I don't have a single part of
that stuff implemented so it's purely conjecture and could very easily be wrong.
It's not much of an excuse but that would be the main reason why I've taken so long to really
work on it and add anything to my paper.
