Weirdly enough I'm fairly confident that I can get this project done and have enough
to talk about already in order to have the final paper done. The only issue is getting
the actual game in a state that I think is worthy of being finished. And based on what
I've done with OpenGL already and what I feel I myself am capable of doing I have a
fair amount of confidence in getting this project almost completely done in time for the
final deadline. If anything the part I'm most worried about is the presentation, because I
probably won't have that much to show about my project in terms of actual game, but I
have a fair amount I can talk about so I think it should be fine.
