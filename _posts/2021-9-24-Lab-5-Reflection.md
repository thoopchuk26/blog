  This lab was interesting because I've always really enjoyed working with data in the context of a database
and abstracting out the functionality of a database like this is a really good way to get a full idea of what
exactly is the best way to go about creating and interacting with a database used on a regular basis.

  For this specific scenario, while there was a lot of information in terms of attributes, the actual
entities and how the interacted with each other mostly made sense. Although I'm still not completely used
working with Vertabelo and getting everything setup properly. It's a lot easier to write it out on paper to
get the ball rolling.
