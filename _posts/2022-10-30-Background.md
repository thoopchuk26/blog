Once the basic procedural stuff is done I'm gonna have to start applying perlin noise to the generation because
on it's own the procedural generation just generates a flat plane. As an end goal for this project I would
like to at least have a topology to my world even if there's nothing really going on underneath like different
block types and cave generation (not happening). I have a general idea of how to do that so I'm hoping
the implementation isn't too difficult, there's also a fair amount of documentation about it so I'm in
good hands.
