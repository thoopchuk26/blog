A couple things that I definitely am not sure I'll get done. Actual procedural generation
using perlin noise is something I'm really not sure about getting done at all and I have
no real basis for thinking I can get it done in a timely manner.

Another thing that I don't have a good basis for how hard it is but I'm
expecting it to be more difficult than I think is any actual collision in the world.
Conceptually I assume there's a lot of good resources about that for openGL but it's
something that I feel might end up being a lot more work than I want it to be, and also
it's not really relevant to the actual gameplay in my opinion, what's more important is the base stuff.
