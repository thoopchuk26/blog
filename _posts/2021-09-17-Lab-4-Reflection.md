  Not much of this lab specifically was new to me as much as it was different applications of something I've already
done, although just being able to create a .md file and have that link to a new page directory on the site was new and
also extremely convenient.

  Unfortunately I struggled far more than I needed to because I somehow spliced two different steps together. Instead of
having both a _layouts folder and a _includes folder with their respective files I had a _layouts folder with the header.html
file in it which meant all my edits to try and put a link there did nothing and confused and annoyed me for an hour.

  I'm not entirely sure what all the different syntax in the header.html and post.html files are actually doing although
I assume they're working in my best interest even if I can't read it.

  I'm looking forward to having more flexibility with the design and layout of the site through using template styles
so as to not actually ever have to write html code on my own.

  Here's two cool websites, [trust him][cool website], [always liked this one][less cool website].

  Unrelated but I've been thinking about buying an electric skateboard or a guitar with the relief check.
