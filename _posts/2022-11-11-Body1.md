Welcome to my transition to OpenGL, it's gonna take some getting used to buts gonna look
so much better by the end of this I promise. Anyways to recap, my render engine works exactly
as intended, completely from scratch, no external libraries to be seen. The problem is that my
optimization is pretty much nonexistant and if I ever want to do any kind of rendering at scale
the slowdown is just insanely bad. I need a new solution.

The solution is OpenGL. Something I
probably should've just used from the beginning but frankly it's not important anymore. I've spent
about a week in OpenGL doing stuff since my last post and frankly the stuff you can get done,
without an insane amount of work completely eclipses my last project. I feel so much more confident
about actually getting this project done even if it means I have to sacrifice some of the work I made
on my previous project to get there.
