Alright so now that I restarted what's the plan and what can I conceivably get done
before the deadline? Based one what I was able to get done in the previous project, and
what I've looked at online for how to get some of this stuff done, I think at minimum
I should be able to create a flat infinite plane of blocks generated in chunks. In terms
of generation that's the minimum that I think I can get done.

In terms of actual gameplay, I should be able to get full mouse and keyboard movement,
as well as allowing the player to actually interact with the world by destroying and placing
blocks. My initial thought is shooting a ray from the camera to where the camera is pointing
and destroying or placing a block based on whether or not the player left clicks or right clicks.
