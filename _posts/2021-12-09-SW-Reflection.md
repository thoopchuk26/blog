I think listening skills are a large factor in determining the quality of work and how well the client receives it. We are not
building a website for our own purposes we are building it for someone else, and building a website that they want is ultimately
more important than anything else for the project. We need to make sure we listen to suggestions and criticism about our website
to make it the best website for our client.

Our project was mostly involved with preparing for a community gathering, so while I can't say that it creates a large amount
of social change, it certainly promotes community within the people of Conway and Hendrix. And I would like to think that
that's equally as important as social change can be. Promoting connection within the larger community is always something
I find important and I hope that when the party eventually happens, everything goes well.

I can't really say that building the website changed any of my core values or ideals but it was very interesting to work on
a project that will legitimately be seen by a large amount of people as an official website of our school. It's really school
to think that a project we worked on in college will be used in such a professional setting.

I think community is important when it comes to towns like this so working on this project helped me contextualize the lengths
people go to foster that sense of community. Through get togethers and parties, the likes of which we have literally made
a website for, people come together to enjoy other people's company and whatever festivities may be going on. I really
appreciate that the project we worked in is working towards fostering a greater sense of community in both Hendrix and Conway.
