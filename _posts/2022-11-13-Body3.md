Sorry if there isn't a ton of useful information in these posts I'm mostly just using it
as a means to talk about general things that have happened since I lost custody of my previous
project to the problem dimension. Don't worry I can still see him on weekends.

Anyways I'm just about done with getting a 3D file importer implemented so I can use this for more than just cubes
in the future if that ever becomes something I want to do. From there I probably need to get started
on actually figuring out how procedural generation in OpenGL is usually structured, because that's still
something I'm not exactly sure on how to do efficiently. It'll probably end fine though. I'm hoping
to at least have something akin to that done by next week and hopefully be started or finishing up
a perlin noise implemenation and applying it to the generation. Honestly at that point I wouldn't
feel too bad turning it in just like that but I've still got stuff I want to get done so I won't stop working
on it regardless. See ya the next time I don't do an assignment on time.
