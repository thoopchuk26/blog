It's me, ya boi, who has once again restarted the project because c++ is too hard
to read. It's honestly impressive, I came back to my project after not really working
on it for like 2 weeks and it felt like a different person had wrote it, I had no idea
what I was doing.

So anyways I restarted going down the rabbit hole of OpenGL. I definitely learned a
lot from working on the previous project because it was basically just going through
a tutorial on OpenGL and learning the gist of it. But I didn't learn enough to fully
understand what it was that I had written and thus it was nigh impossible to come back to
it in a meaningful manner, because the second it breaks I have no idea why.
