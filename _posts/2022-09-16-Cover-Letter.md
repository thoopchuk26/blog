Not gonna lie, I pretty much completely forgot about turning in the Cover Letter, I basically had it
all done it just completely slipped my mind to finish it up at the end of the day Friday.

Regardless I plan to finish it up later today, for reference the job this Cover Letter is for is
Riot Games as an intern for the upcoming summer. I should have it in by around 10PM at the latest
as all I have to finish is the latter half talking about my qualifications and whatnot. A lot of my
work is based on the examples I got from Career Services but I'd like to think I put enough work
in to make it my own.

In the meantime here's a gif giving a rough show of what I've got done so far on my capstone project.
I hear that the render glitching out gives it charm.
