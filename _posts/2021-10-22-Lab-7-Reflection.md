Funny story, I wrote out this entire blog post already and apparently never pushed it to the github so here
I am writing it again.

The easiest part was certainly creating the project as that requires no work of my own and only requires
using the Asp.net framework included.

In terms of difficult sections, when it comes to editing the page itself and not just the database information
is very confusing and overall just a mess of html and css files. It feels entirely unparseable and simply
a mess of trial and error to try and find the information you want to edit on the site. Stuff like titles,
web directories, and web formatting is really hard to find and edit to my desires.

Overall actually editing the database and creating database objects was fairly straightforward for me
and didn't cause me too much trouble though thankfully.

The framework itself looks very similar to how Jekyll pages are laid out aesthetically and functionally which
is interesting.

I'm not particularly confident of using Razor pages for any type of project on a larger scale. The database
information isn't too hard to work with but editing and adding functionality to the page itself is very hard
and tedious to try and do.
