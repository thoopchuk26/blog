What's going on, it's me, the least productive person on this entire planet. Gonna be
entirely honest. I haven't worked on this project at all since my last blog post. I'm
weirdly close to the end of this project and getting a little content with what I already
have done but obviously it looks nothing like a game yet. I feel like I can pretty much
make this entire Senior Project work with just talking about the render engine, and while
that's not something I want to do because I think it would be lame, it's certainly
made me quite lazy and not interested to work on the project further.

Also I'm kinda stumbling my way through opengl learning as I go, and while that's pretty interesting,
this isn't exactly the best environment to be learning a whole new engine at this point.
I'm learning a lot of things that are specific to Minecraft and not really general knowledge
or best practice which I don't like because I'd like to use OpenGL to do more than this
later on when I work on more personal projects.

I don't have anything to show for my work since I last posted so I suppose I will include
a picture of one of the things that's been taking my mind off of school for a bit too long.
