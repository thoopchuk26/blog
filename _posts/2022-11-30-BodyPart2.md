I have finally found the will and ideas to talk about in order to get enough of
this draft part 2 turned in and I swear that it will be turned in. This has taken
me far too long for no reason and I really apologize for that. I've just been really
drained ever since November started and have had little to no motivation to do
much of anything to finish this project. It's not a good excuse but it's just where
my heads been at this whole time and it's not been great. Apologies.
