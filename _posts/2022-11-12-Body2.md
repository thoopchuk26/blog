Now that we have our new project structure decided upon what's new and what can I expect to have
by this time next week. Also what do I currently have would be relevant information. A lot of
what I've been doing reecently has been following the tutorial found [here][opengl tutorial], I've
just about got through the whole thing but basically I've been setting up a small little engine
that should work for just about any type of 3D game, and then from there I can focus on making
stuff for specifically Minecraft.

So far I've still been learning the basics and getting used to
the environment but OpenGL lets you do some complicated stuff with not a lot of lines of code
so I feel pretty liberated considering what I had been working on. Anyways here's wonderwall.
